When Alyssa atempts to compute the square root we get an inifinte loop and our program will brake.
This is happening because we are using the oridinary procedure when having a recursive call.
Instead of the function to evaluate the parameters and return a value, the function calls iteself continously due to interpreters applicative order evaluation.
